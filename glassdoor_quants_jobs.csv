In the Front Office quant group we solve those complex problems for derivatives traders. Since 2008 demand for efficient solutions to large scale risk calculations has drastically increased and the quant team has come up with a novel solution to meet this challenge. The XingCredibles are tasked with making it happen, whether that means analyzing current results, troubleshooting peculiar problems that others cannot solve or coming up with a solution, be it an interface and/or framework extensions or a fix in the library we own. The novel solution, called Xi Next Gen (XiNG), works cross asset class, which means you will get exposure to many if not all of Rates, Equity, FX, Commodities, Mortgages and Credit derivatives. It will require the ability to jump in and figure out how stuff works, be resourceful and find your own path. In many cases this also means connecting to the different quants in those asset class teams, learning from them and coming up together with a solution. To expand on the above with more, dry, details: you will be part of the XiNG task force, a team of 10 people. This team is part of Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA), a group of a couple of hundred people spread around the world with hubs in London and New York city. MQA is part of Markets which covers most of Citi's derivatives trading. Markets is part of the Institutional Clients Group. Ideally you have a few years of Front Office quant (dev) experience, working in C++11 and python. This would include exposure to continuous integration, test driven development, good software design, some experience with mathematical solutions to derivative pricing/risk calculations like Monte Carlo or Partial Differential Equation solvers. A bachelors in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math field is a hard requirement. You will join a very cooperative group of people, with the focus on getting things done as a team, both in the XingCredibles as in the global quant group as a whole. There will be ample opportunity to discuss interesting, complex matters, to learn from quants with many years of experience.

3.5",-1,-1,-1,Lending,"Do you like solving complex puzzles? Do you have grit and get energized when digging your teeth into a problem? Then keep reading. In the Front Office quant group we solve those complex problems for derivatives traders. Since 2008 demand for efficient solutions to large scale risk calculations has drastically increased and the quant team has come up with a novel solution to meet this challenge. The XingCredibles are tasked with making it happen, whether that means analyzing current results, troubleshooting peculiar problems that others cannot solve or coming up with a solution, be it an interface and/or framework extensions or a fix in the library we own. The novel solution, called Xi Next Gen (XiNG), works cross asset class, which means you will get exposure to many if not all of Rates, Equity, FX, Commodities, Mortgages and Credit derivatives. It will require the ability to jump in and figure out how stuff works, be resourceful and find your own path. In many cases this also means connecting to the different quants in those asset class teams, learning from them and coming up together with a solution. To expand on the above with more, dry, details: you will be part of the XiNG task force, a team of 10 people. This team is part of Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA), a group of a couple of hundred people spread around the world with hubs in London and New York city. MQA is part of Markets which covers most of Citi's derivatives trading. Markets is part of the Institutional Clients Group. Ideally you have a few years of Front Office quant (dev) experience, working in C++11 and python. This would include exposure to continuous integration, test driven development, good software design, some experience with mathematical solutions to derivative pricing/risk calculations like Monte Carlo or Partial Differential Equation solvers. A bachelors in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math field is a hard requirement. You will join a very cooperative group of people, with the focus on getting things done as a team, both in the XingCredibles as in the global quant group as a whole. There will be ample opportunity to discuss interesting, complex matters, to learn from quants with many years of experience. Last but not least, the XingCredibles are diverse in many dimensions and if we can increase our diversity, that would be even better. ------------------------------------------------- Job Family Group: Institutional Trading ------------------------------------------------- Job Family: Quantitative Analysis ------------------------------------------------------ Time Type: Full time ------------------------------------------------------ Citi is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer.

"J.Crew
3.9",-1,1983,-1,"Department, Clothing, & Shoe Stores","WHO WE ARE

We side with style over fashion, think timelessness is underrated and find that clothes look best when they’re lived in. We love color-blocking and pattern mixing and temper tomboy with heels. We're fans of tousled hair and think everything’s right when something’s left just a little imperfect. We wear sneakers with suits, wing tips with jeans and chambray on chambray. We don't believe there's such a thing as overdressed — and we don’t rent tuxedos. We're an American brand, but we source fabrics from around the world: Japanese seersucker, Irish linen and Italian wool. We don't believe there's just one way to wear an outfit, but we do have a few ideas on how to pull one together. For us, the magic is in the mix.

ABOUT THE TEAM

The Analyst should be adept at analyzing and synthesizing information – and also have a sharp eye for detail and nuance.

This position reports to the Senior Web Analytics Manager.

Act as an internal expert on Adobe Analytics (Omniture) capabilities and site tagging

In the Front Office quant group we solve those complex problems for derivatives traders. Since 2008 demand for efficient solutions to large scale risk calculations has drastically increased and the quant team has come up with a novel solution to meet this challenge. The XingCredibles are tasked with making it happen, whether that means analyzing current results, troubleshooting peculiar problems that others cannot solve or coming up with a solution, be it an interface and/or framework extensions or a fix in the library we own. The novel solution, called Xi Next Gen (XiNG), works cross asset class, which means you will get exposure to many if not all of Rates, Equity, FX, Commodities, Mortgages and Credit derivatives. It will require the ability to jump in and figure out how stuff works, be resourceful and find your own path. In many cases this also means connecting to the different quants in those asset class teams, learning from them and coming up together with a solution. To expand on the above with more, dry, details: you will be part of the XiNG task force, a team of 10 people. This team is part of Markets Quantitative Analysis (MQA), a group of a couple of hundred people spread around the world with hubs in London and New York city. MQA is part of Markets which covers most of Citi's derivatives trading. Markets is part of the Institutional Clients Group. Ideally you have a few years of Front Office quant (dev) experience, working in C++11 and python. This would include exposure to continuous integration, test driven development, good software design, some experience with mathematical solutions to derivative pricing/risk calculations like Monte Carlo or Partial Differential Equation solvers. A bachelors in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math field is a hard requirement. You will join a very cooperative group of people, with the focus on getting things done as a team, both in the XingCredibles as in the global quant group as a whole. There will be ample opportunity to discuss interesting, complex matters, to learn from quants with many years of experience.

We're fans of tousled hair and think everything’s right when something’s left just a little imperfect. We wear sneakers with suits, wing tips with jeans and chambray on chambray. We don't believe there's such a thing as overdressed — and we don’t rent tuxedos. We're an American brand, but we source fabrics from around the world: Japanese seersucker, Irish linen and Italian wool.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together.
