•Develop code libraries and solutions that leverage and appropriately augment existing structures to meet the needs of the research-driven investment and analysis processes (including analyses requested by or directed to clients and prospects), often in the absence of clearly documented specifications.

•Guide analysts and other Multi Asset associates in current technology best practices and advise or teach better programming techniques where needed and appropriate

•Consult with core developers (IT) to identify which interim solutions (e.g., tools, applications, reports, data structures, etc.) have matured sufficiently to transition to a production environment, and produce specifications for such solutions, enabling IT to elevate strategically targeted prototypes to production.

•Maintain knowledge in the field by reading professional journals, talking with other researchers, and attending professional conferences.

REQUIREMENTS:

•Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Physics); strong academic credentials

•Established track record (5+ years) developing software and applications, including experience in quantitative/modeling environments (e.g. Matlab, Splus, R, Python) and SQL databases

•Practical understanding of Computer Science fundamentals and all layers of modern application design

•Demonstrated ability to learn and work in new computing environments and languages

•Ability to pivot between prototyping, refactoring, and production-ready development styles, ideally demonstrated by prior experience

•Evidence of ability to independently deliver results and self-direction, along with strong initiative

•Strong analytical and problem-solving skills; willingness to learn new approaches to problem-solving

•Familiarity with financial markets across asset classes, supported by coursework and experience

•Demonstrated interest in understanding the broader business context within which a technology solution is needed (focus on the problem, not the code)

•Experience working with large, complex data sets

•Ability to modulate oral and written communications to different levels of technical capability

•Comfort with ambiguity in problem specification and still-emerging objectives; ability and willingness to adjust to mid-stream changes in objectives or process

•High level of pragmatism; able to apply varying levels of rigor appropriately to different projects based on the nature of the project and surrounding circumstances

•Ability to multi-task and to simultaneously push forward several projects

•Experience leading projects involving teams featuring a heterogenous mix of skill sets

•Experience navigating and bridging gaps in context or understanding that arise between Investment and Technology components of an organization

•Experience leading a small or medium-sized team consisting of other developers or equivalents

Liaise with internal stakeholders and participate in firm-wide efforts involving multi-asset topics. Execute operational duties, such as ongoing generation and maintenance of related investment reports, data sets, or analytical infrastructure. Keep abreast of industry trends in the areas of asset allocation and quantitative financial techniques (e.g., reading applied academic literature).

REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS
Ph.D. in a quantitative discipline (e.g. Math, Engineering, or Physics) with a strong background including one or more of the following: optimization and operations research, signal processing and optimal control, statistics or stochastic processes, and applied mathematics

As great as our clients are, the success of our own firm is driven by two things – people and culture. Many companies use the mantra “client first.” We are not such an organization.

If our team delivers tangible results to our clients, our clients reward the firm.

Our culture is about personal development. Our goal is to “Accelerate Growth,” not just for our clients, but for our team. In fact, at the core of our leadership development plan is the philosophy of servant leadership which mandates a focus on development of the team. We work hard to maintain our culture by executing consistent monthly trainings, bringing in outside speakers, holding “one on ones” with leadership, and many more. We invest heavily in growing our team because that is what grows our firm.

The best part is, not only do we get to work with dynamic companies every day, we are part of one ourselves.

The ouroboros (literally “tail devourer” in Greek) is an ancient Egyptian icon which depicts a snake, or sometimes a dragon, eating its own tail. Among the oldest known mystical symbols in the world, it embodies the cyclical nature of time and the universe. Ouroboros symbolizes infinity, life, death, rebirth, fertility, creation resulting from destruction and the idea of all things coming full circle. The serpent consumes itself to sustain its own life in a never-ending revolution of renewal. The tail, like the past, seeming to vanish but, in reality, continuing in a new dimension, on another plane or in a new position… Which reminds me of what it’s like for us when we hire BUSINESS ANALYSTS.

POSITION OVERVIEW

The Risk Modeling group is seeking an analyst to help develop cash flow models describing a variety of liabilities that GA either already has on its balance sheet, considering selling, or considering reinsuring. Besides producing economic cash flows, a number of GAAP or regulatory balances would also fall under the purview. The work would be carried out in a combination of R3S (an actuarial projection software) and Python.

The results of this modeling work would drive hedging, ALM decisions, and would help more generally with quantifying a number of market and insurance risks. Additionally, the work would aid GA's forecasting and serve as a check against the financial reporting models owned by other areas of the firm.

Risk Modeling team works closely with other areas of Risk team as well as Product, Reinsurance Deal team, ALM, Hedging, Finance, Actuarial, FP&A, and IT. As part of a larger quantitative Insurance Risk Management team that reports through the Chief Risk Officer, we have unique vantage point into nearly all aspects of the enterprise.

We are looking for a highly curious individual who is comfortable in a fast-paced collaborative environment, and who enjoys seeing the things they build have real world impact.

QUALIFICATIONS

• Degree in actuarial science, math, statistics, computer science, a physical or biological science, engineering, or related field.
• Familiarity with actuarial projections would be helpful but not necessary
• Several years of experience or course work in a programming language such as Python, C/C++, or Java would be hepful
• Background in finance and/or industry experience is not required.

At Global Atlantic, enjoy a highly competitive compensation and benefits package, with a focus on pay equity and flexibility. We are proud to support work/life balance that meet individual and business needs. A business casual dress code, above-average paid time off, parental and military leave, adoption assistance and tuition reimbursement are just a few of the extra perks that make Global Atlantic a great place to work. We strive to foster a culture of total well-being through community outreach and charitable giving programs.

Social platforms provide an environment to collaborate with others and participate in friendly competitions towards achieving physical, emotional and financial well-being. Our highly competitive health, retirement, life and disability plans can be tailored to best suit your needs and those of your whole family.

Global Atlantic is committed to creating an inclusive environment where everyone can meaningfully contribute to our success. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer and we do not discriminate in employment on any basis that is prohibited by federal, state or local laws. More than that, we strive to be inclusive of all backgrounds and experiences, which we feel gives us a competitive advantage in the market and within our firm.

Our role in these partnerships goes end to end—we handle everything from wrangling the data to analyzing the problem to turning the results into something actionable.

Nucleus is looking for a Senior Investment and Business Product Analyst to join our rapidly-growing team. Nucleus Advisors has depth in all the competencies of a traditional wealth advisory firm, but our goal is to keep building connection competencies. As such, we vigilantly work to improve our client connections as we continue to transform. This new senior leader will support Nucleus with the traditional wealth advisory toolkit, but will also play a leadership role in our digital transformation.

Nucleus's connections, curiosity, diversity and depth are an extension of our Withness mind-set, our learning orientation and our personally invested commitment.

We are seeking candidates who are team-centric, learning-oriented, business-minded, data-driven, and able to translate large and complex data sets into meaningful information and have the desire to influence Nucleus's decisions and performance. As a Senior Investment and Business Product Analyst, you will be working with our Chief Investment Officer, the Client Service team, Business Intelligence Analysts from our marketing partner, our newly forming Risk Management Platform team, our Head of Practice on Product and Marketing forecasting, reporting, and strategic decision support.

The successful candidate will have 5+ years of progressive experience in finance, payment, economics or statistics, and be comfortable with both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

In summary, our new Senior Investment and Business Product Analyst will have:
A Bachelor's degree
5+ years of financial industry experience

High proficiency with Microsoft Excel, as well as the overall Microsoft Office Suite
Attained or interested in pursuing a CFP or CFA professional designation
Openness to learning, positive attitude, desire to collaborate and solve complex problems, and a passion for preeminence
The exact length of each rotation will be flexible and depended on the need of the team at the time.

At the end of the rotation, the analyst will have the opportunity to lead a key business action team of Nucleus Advisors.
